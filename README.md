# Investigating-the-Impact-of-an-EEG-Device-s-Quality-on-the-Accuracy-of-Imagined-Speech-Classificatio
This Study investigates the extent at which it is possible to achieve similar Classification accuracy's from data produced from a lower quality EEG with 14-channels and a 256Hz sampling rate in the FEIS dataset \citep{FEIS} vs that of the a higher quality EEG with 62-channels and a 1000Hz sampling rate in the Kara One Dataset \citep{zhao2015classifying}. These were evaluated across 4 binary tasks using the SVM, Random Forest and KNN machine learning classifiers and a range of deep and non-deep learning feature extraction methods to understand which is optimal. The results show on the whole the disparity between the device accuracy's to be rather small in all of the binary tasks bar one. The Random Forest algorithm appears to be the classifier which obtains the highest accuracy's across the two results with the non-deep learning feature extractor methods outperforming that of the Siamese Neural Network deep learning method
